Intention: 

I have the following personal tendencies, to explore and to systemize. These I apply here. A further intention might be "to know." 

Here are some common reasons:

(1) Inner peace
(2) Life after death / freedom from reincarnation
(3) Faustian quest for knowledge. Truth?
(4) Despair over the way the world is
(5) Power to obtain things or rule people

--

(6) Love

Of these, the only valid intention I believe is (6) although

<-- split between truth and love?
