Do2.5 90M_hl ob: Doing a terrible job of keeping track. New commitments this week to (1) no more than one meal with meat per week (2) no more than one alchoholic beverage per week (3) one day (24hrs) of fasting per week. Will attempt to record the day upon which this happened. Also adding sitting style to record.

ob: 
Procrastination, sources and resolutions: 
General process "Stress" triggers meltdown, despondency, then later rebound after a period of depression -- assuming that there is an absolute deadline which must be met, otherwise, there is no clear regrouping. Us. there is some dissolving of daily habits, which serves as a warning of sorts. At some point, there is a period of obsessive computer game playing and serial mast. which may continue for several days. Generally speaking, there are no breaks except for food and the process continues until complete exhaustion. 

The first trigger seems to be the necessity of completing a large undesirable task. Small undesirable tasks may be procrastinated on, but large undesirable tasks seem to trigger a larger reaction, perhaps because they must be grappled with. One possible "solution" is to "drug" oneself with caffine and place oneself in a place where one has little choice except to work on the project in question (e.g. a cafe), and where other people are working. 

A potential secondary solution is to segment the work. This involves the creation of an outline and the ability to work on different portions each day. 

Once triggered, the "procrastination" urge is extremely strong and make take any number of unaware and negative objects. Be wary.

ob: more or less recovered without slipping into depressive state, although without enough energy to pursue other things. Excess sexual energy controlling throughts seems to be somewhat subdued also, at least as compared to the last two days which were incredibly dissolute. Will need to make a second serious attempt, but will probably wait until next Monday.
Slacking a bit on meat resolution, as there are additional dishes with tiny bits of meat that I have been eating. Have not fasted yet this week, I think i will do a fruit juice fast of sorts today.
Need to journal seems increased when the routine is in threat of being broken, which usually only happens after it is already broken somewhat (happening without realization), and then when the realization is realized.
