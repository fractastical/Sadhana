(1) Interact only with people who share certain basic ethical principles

(2) If something is transmitted as a secret, keep it a secret

(3) Assume the best of everyone, but only consider proof what one has personally experienced

(4) Prioritize the "what?" over the "why?" "how?" and esp. "whither?" 

(5) Evaluate after the fact rather than during (esp. important for meditation)

(6) Examine yourself. Assume as little as possible. Know what you don't know.

(7) Intention: I have the following personal tendencies, to explore and to systemize. These I apply here. A further intention might be "to know," and this pursuit of knowledge might be considered Faustian, and not acceptable by the normal canons of morality.

(8) Finding "one who knows" : Numerous traditions place emphasis on masters, and although knowledge is implied by the title, there have always been many more people claiming knowledge than actually possessing it. Moveover, one who has only superficial knowledge in a given is not necessarily capable of providing necessary guidance.
