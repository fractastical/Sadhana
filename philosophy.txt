The philosophy that underlies this practice has evolved with time through the practice itself and will, most likely, continue to evolve. At first, it was motivated by simple curosity, what are these practices that have been traditionally in "esoteric" schools and what is their effect? Even the causal observer will quickly notice that related traditions have certain curious commonalities concerning potentially moving energy, channels in the body by which this energy circulates, and energy "centers." However, just as curious are the divergences between the traditions. For instance, while modern Yoga has managed to develops a roughly similar set of poses, with the exception of seated meditation poses, these bare little resemblence to the Chinese varieties existent today (known as martial arts, Qigong or Taiji). My practice has evolved to answer certain questions, which include the following:

   (1) What are the origins of these practices?
   (2) What does one gain from these practices?
   (3) Do these practices make one a "better person" ? In other words, how do they relate to ethics?
   (4) How do literary or philosophical works relate to these practices (esp. obscure passages)?
   (5) How do these practices relate to "established religion" ?

Although I greatly appreciate the efforts of academia in this regard, it was clear to me that the only key to answering these questions was significant involvement in practice in these traditions. It was also clear to me that my results would not likely be acceptable in many institutions in the West, which usually attempt to stay clear of association with advocacy for any spiritual practice.

To answer these questons, it was clear that I must practice more, which is why I am currently no longer in academia.
