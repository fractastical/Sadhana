This is a transposed form of previous digital/paper notes for the purpose of tracking practices and their effects. The practices I use are drawn from traditional Buddhist meditative practice (mostly learned while I was the assistant for the Contemplative Studies Initiative at Brown University), Qigong as taught to me by "masters" in China and through the Healing Dao school in the US, Yoga in the Sivananda school, Yoga in the Kripalu lineage (as taught by Yoganand), Yoga as part of the Advanced Yoga Practice taught by Yogani, and various practices part of the Clairvision school. I am also involved with various activites in Rome where I now live.

Since many of these techniques can be dangerous, no instruction is provided nor is advocacy presumed. I simply note briefly what I am doing, with no guarantee that this information is complete. See the key for information.
