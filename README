This is a transposed form of previous digital/paper notes for the purpose of tracking practices and their effects. The practices I use are drawn from traditional Buddhist meditative practice (mostly learned while I was the assistant for the Contemplative Studies Initiative at Brown University), Qigong as taught to me by "masters" in China and through the Healing Dao school in the US, Yoga in the Kripalu lineage (as taught by Yoganand), Yoga as part of the Advanced Yoga Practice taught by Yogani, Yoga in the Sivananda ashram where I completed a teacher training course, Kundalini Yoga, Forrest Yoga as taught by Ana Forrest, and various practices part of the Clairvision school. 

Since many of these techniques can be dangerous, no instruction is provided nor should advocacy be presumed. I provide my notes for the purpose of accountablity and information, yet the information is limited by what I chose to share. See the key for information.
